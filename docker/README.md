# Getting started with Docker
Docker is the most widely used platform for containerization. It provides a simple way to create, deploy, and manage containers. A Docker container image is a lightweight, standalone, executable package of software that includes everything needed to run an application: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries, and settings. Docker containers are highly portable, meaning they can run on any system that supports the Docker runtime, including on-premises servers, cloud environments, and even edge devices.

The practice of containerization and “dockerization” are important for consistency across environments, portability, scalability, isolation, and efficient resource utilization. This accelerates development, testing, and deployment processes, allowing teams to deliver updates and new features more quickly.    
The main Docker components are DockerFile, image, and a container. Docker Hub contains several Official Images for use with any project. These resources include numerous tags.

This repository follows a sample application for users following the getting started guide at https://docs.docker.com/get-started/.

The application is based on the application from the getting started tutorial at https://github.com/docker/getting-started
