# Overview of Terraform
**Terraform** is an open-source IaC tool developed by HashiCorp. It allows users to define and provision data center infrastructure using a high-level configuration language called HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL) or optionally JSON. Terraform manages external resources like public and private cloud infrastructure, network appliances, software as a service, and platform as a service through a provider-based architecture. It maintains the state of the managed infrastructure, enabling incremental changes.

Terraform is one of the leading IaC tools in production due to its Multi-Provider Support, Idempotency, Modularity, Community, and Ecosystem.

# Terraform Syntax and Configuration Files
Terraform configurations are written in HCL or JSON and typically consist of one or more files ending in .tf. These files define the infrastructure resources and their properties. Common Commands and Workflows are:

+ *Terraform init*: Initializes a working directory containing Terraform configuration files.
+ *Terraform plan*: Create an execution plan, showing what actions Terraform will take.
+ *Terraform apply*: Applies the changes required to reach the desired state of the configuration.
+ *Terraform destroy*: Destroys all managed infrastructure. 

# Terraform and GKE Integration
To configure Terraform for **Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)**, you need to set up the Google Cloud provider and define the necessary resources. A standard GKE Terraform configuration includes Provider Configuration: to define the Google Cloud provider and authentication. Resource Definitions specify the resources for the GKE cluster, node pools, and networking. Outputs highlighting cluster credentials
