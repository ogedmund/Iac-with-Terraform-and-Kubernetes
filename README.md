# Iac with Terraform and Kubernetes
In the advancing landscape of cloud computing and DevOps, managing infrastructure efficiently is crucial for maintaining scalable and reliable applications. This project centers on using Terraform, an infrastructure-as-code tool, to provision and manage Kubernetes clusters on cloud platforms Google Cloud Platform. 

The integration of Terraform with Kubernetes is key to deploying and managing applications effectively. This project will provide experience in using Terraform to set up and manage Kubernetes infrastructure, including deploying applications and utilizing Googleâ€™s controllers to optimize resource management.

# Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) Module
This repository contains a [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) module for running a Kubernetes cluster on [Google Cloud Platform (GCP)](https://cloud.google.com/?hl=en) using [Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine?hl=en)
